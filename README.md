# RISCV MYTH course
# DAY 1
The day 1 of this course covered the introduction to the RISC-V ISA, GNU compiler, binary number systemms, unsigned 64-bit binary number system and signed 64-bit binary system.
## Binary number system 
The binary number system  contains only two number that are 0 and 1 and a bit is the digit of a binary number a group og 8 bits is called a byte and a group of 32 bits is called a word. Similarly a group of 64 bits is called a doubleword.
If a have a 2-bit binary umber the number of possible pattern for these two numbers are 00,01,10,11. Only these are the 4 combinations of a 2-binary number. The number of possiblities of minary number having `n` number of bits can be calculated by the following formula:
2^n suppose i have a 5-bit number the  number of possiblities is 2*2*2*2*2 = **32 possiblities**

### Unsigned numbers
In binary, an unsigned number is a representation of a non-negative integer, meaning it only represents positive whole numbers and zero. It doesn't have a sign bit to indicate positivity or negativity. like 00000001 is a binary number equivalent to decimal number 1 
it does not have a sign bit to indicatw whether this number is positive or negative in its MSD (Most significant Bit).
